pmap is used in ai-find-best-move, minimax depth = 3, board: 8 x 8

In find-state-in-dir function an option added to to either collect captured
stones or skip them. Helped to improve time. (Total duration for the
previous tests mentioned below was roughly 50-55 seconds)

white: 0 black: 55 / black wins.

total duration of the game: 43.343 secs
time per one move:
                 [white stones]       [black stones]         [all stones]
