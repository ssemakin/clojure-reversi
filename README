===========

Tried some simple tests with map and pmap used in the top level of the minimax.

#1 plain map is used in ai-find-best-move, minimax depth = 3, board: 8 x 8

white: 0 black: 55 / black wins.

time per one move:
                 [white stones]       [black stones]         [all stones]
  average:           1.616 secs           1.970 secs           1.796 secs
      max:           5.927 secs           7.769 secs           7.769 secs
      min:          18.19 msecs           2.04 msecs           2.04 msecs


#2 pmap is used in ai-find-best-move, minimax depth = 3, board: 8 x 8

white: 0 black: 55 / black wins.

time per one move:
                 [white stones]       [black stones]         [all stones]
  average:         894.24 msecs           1.076 secs         986.97 msecs
      max:           3.082 secs           4.086 secs           4.086 secs
      min:          17.15 msecs           1.93 msecs           1.93 msecs
